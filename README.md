# Business-Insight-Dashboard-Hotel-RR

Project Overview:



From Jan – Mar 2025, I worked as a freelance Data Analyst for Hotel Royal Retreat (Shirdi, Maharashtra), where I analyzed over 1,500 booking records. The goal was to identify revenue drivers, track occupancy trends, and support management with data-driven decision-making.



Key Contributions:


-Designed an Excel-based Business Insights Dashboard visualizing KPIs such as Occupancy %, ADR, RevPAR, Revenue by Booking Source, and Room-Type Profitability.

-Performed data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization to ensure accurate reporting and usability.

-Delivered insights that highlighted top-performing room types and booking channels, guiding pricing and marketing strategy.



Key Business Insights:


-Revenue Analysis: Generated total revenue of ₹3.75 Cr from ~1,500 bookings over a 4–5 month period, validating the hotel’s financial performance.

-Room-Type Performance: Identified that Deluxe Rooms contributed ~40% of total revenue (₹93.4L), followed by Suites (~32%, ₹71.5L), making them the most profitable categories.

-Occupancy Insights: Reported Deluxe (40%) and Suite (32%) as highest in occupancy share, while Executive rooms lagged at ~9–11%, signaling underperformance.

-Booking Source Contribution: Determined that the Website channel generated the highest revenue (₹93.4L+), outperforming Travel Agents (₹37.6L), Walk-ins (₹34.7L), and Corporate bookings (₹18.9L), proving digital channels as the most profitable.

-Seasonality Trend: Discovered December and March as peak revenue months, each exceeding ₹1 Cr, while January showed relatively lower earnings, suggesting season-driven demand.

-Customer Satisfaction: Tracked average satisfaction score of 3.7/5, with a slight upward trend across months, indicating gradual improvement in guest experience.
